# You might be wondering, "some of the commands thats in the production bot aint here"
You're 100% correct, that is due to some licensing issues, and the fact that Kanelbulle isnt just one thread to discord, it uses diffrent languages for diffrent reasons and commands.
The code included is the core part.
Non core part are things like the Starboard that are based upon other users OSS.
And I'm grateful for it. So incase your looking for a specific function that isnt here, check this list and youll find the repository.
